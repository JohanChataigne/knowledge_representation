## NN adviser

The file `nn_adviser.py` contains an implementation of backward and forward chaining, used together to advise to the user what he should use for his classification problem based on the informations he gives to the program.

This expert system is restricted to the really simple task area of classification in ML/DL.

It was planned to generalize more over multiple areas of ML/DL but the task was too hard, mainly because of mutually exclusive facts that are difficult to handle.
Indeed it is hard to deal with this because of the issues involved by the negation (Horn formula). The rules basis planned at the beginning is still available tho (in commentary in the code).
